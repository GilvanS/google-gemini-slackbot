For a detailed step-by-step guide on building this digital assistant, visit [Building a Digital Assistant in Slack with Google Gemini: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.marketcalls.in/python/building-a-digital-assistant-in-slack-with-google-gemini-a-step-by-step-guide.html).

## Prerequisites

- Google Gemini API Key
- Slack App with OAuth & Permissions configured
- Python environment with necessary libraries

## Configuration

Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables. A sample environment file `.env.sample` is provided in the project. Copy this file to a new file named `.env` and update the variables with your own values.

The `.env.sample` file contains the following structure:<br>
<code>
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"<br>
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="your_slack_bot_token_here"<br>
BOT_USER_ID="your_bot_user_id_here"<br>
FLASK_APP=your_entry_point_script_here # e.g., "app.py"<br></code>

### Steps to configure your environment:

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2. Replace `your_google_api_key_here`, `your_slack_bot_token_here`, `your_bot_user_id_here`, and `your_entry_point_script_here` with your actual configuration values.

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or any sensitive credentials to version control. The `.env` file is included in the `.gitignore` to prevent accidental upload.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Obtain Google Gemini API Key**: Visit Google AI Studio and generate an API key for the Gemini API.
2. **Generate Slack App**: Create a new app in Slack and configure basic information, including OAuth scopes required for the bot to function.
3. **Setup Event Subscriptions**: Subscribe to bot events in your Slack app settings to listen for and respond to messages.
4. **Install Your App**: Add your app to your workspace with the necessary permissions.
5. **Development Environment**:
   - Use Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE.
   - Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
   - Install necessary Python libraries including Flask, Slack SDK, and Google Gemini libraries.
6. **Implement Your Slack Bot**: Use Flask for handling Slack events and Google Gemini for generating responses.
7. **Deploy Your Application**: Choose between local testing with ngrok or deploying to Google Cloud App Engine for production.
8. **Configure Slack Event Subscriptions**: Update your Slack app's event subscriptions with your deployment's request URL.
9. **Access Your Slack Bot**: Test your bot via direct message or by mentioning it in a channel.
